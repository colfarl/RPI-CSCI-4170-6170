    "# Part 1: Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we implement a neural network class from scratch without using any deep learning frameworks. We rely on NumPy for numerical computations and Pandas (if needed) for data handling. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we design a feed-forward neural network with:\n",
    "- **Input Layer:** Number of neurons equals the number of features.\n",
    "- **Hidden Layer:** A single hidden layer with a configurable number of neurons using the ReLU activation function.\n",
    "- **Output Layer:** A single neuron (for binary classification) with the Sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `NeuralNetwork` class includes the following methods:\n",
    "1. **Initialization (`__init__`):** Initializes network parameters (weights and biases) for each layer.\n",
    "2. **Forward Propagation (`forward`):** Computes the outputs of each layer:\n",
    "   - Hidden layer: `Z1 = X·W1 + b1` followed by `A1 = ReLU(Z1)`\n",
    "   - Output layer: `Z2 = A1·W2 + b2` followed by `A2 = Sigmoid(Z2)`\n",
    "3. **Cost Calculation (`cost`):** Computes the binary cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "4. **Backward Propagation (`backward`):** Computes the gradients for each parameter using the chain rule:\n",
    "   - For the output layer, using the derivative of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the sigmoid output.\n",
    "   - For the hidden layer, taking into account the derivative of the ReLU activation.\n",
    "5. **Train (`train`):** Uses mini-batch gradient descent to update parameters over several epochs.\n",
    "6. **Predict (`predict`):** Generates predictions for new input data by applying forward propagation and thresholding the output probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Activation Functions:**  \n",
    "  - **ReLU** is used in the hidden layer for its simplicity and effectiveness.\n",
    "  - **Sigmoid** is used in the output layer because we are addressing a binary classification problem.\n",
    "- **Optimization:**  \n",
    "  We use mini-batch gradient descent to update parameters. This approach is more efficient than computing the gradient over the entire dataset, especially for larger datasets.\n",
    "- **Dataset:**  \n",
    "  For demonstration, we generate a synthetic dataset with 10,000 observations using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification`. This dataset is then split into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will present the code implementation.\n"

    "# Implementation of a 2-Layer Neural Network using PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this project, we implement a 2-layer neural network using PyTorch to solve a binary classification problem on the Adult Income dataset. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, is used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds \\$50K per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Steps and Thought Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning:**  \n",
    "  The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features. We handle missing values (e.g., marked as `?`) by removing rows with missing entries.\n",
    "- **Visualization:**  \n",
    "  Basic visualizations such as histograms of numerical features and bar plots for categorical features can be created to understand data distributions and identify potential anomalies. (For brevity, visualizations are not included in the code below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Train-Dev-Test Split\n",
    "- The dataset is split into three subsets:\n",
    "  - **Training Set:** ~70% of the data used for model training.\n",
    "  - **Development (Validation) Set:** ~15% of the data for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "  - **Test Set:** ~15% of the data for final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Preprocessing and Normalization\n",
    "- **Encoding:**  \n",
    "  Categorical features are transformed into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "- **Normalization:**  \n",
    "  Numerical features are standardized (zero mean and unit variance) using StandardScaler. Normalizing inputs helps improve model convergence and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Model Architecture and Forward Propagation\n",
    "- **Network Structure:**  \n",
    "  The model is a 2-layer neural network consisting of:\n",
    "  - **Input Layer:** Receives the preprocessed features.\n",
    "  - **Hidden Layer:** A fully connected layer followed by the ReLU activation function.\n",
    "  - **Output Layer:** A fully connected layer with a Sigmoid activation function, producing output probabilities for the binary classification.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameters:**  \n",
    "  We set the hidden layer size, learning rate, number of epochs, and mini-batch size based on initial experimentation. These may be tuned further based on validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Cost Function\n",
    "- We use the Binary Cross Entropy Loss (BCE Loss) to measure the discrepancy between the predicted probabilities and the actual labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Training with Gradient Descent\n",
    "- **Optimizer:**  \n",
    "  We utilize the Adam optimizer, an adaptive gradient descent algorithm, to update model parameters. Adam is chosen for its efficiency and robust performance on a variety of tasks.\n",
    "- **Gradient Descent Variant:**  \n",
    "  Mini-batch gradient descent is employed. The training data is divided into mini-batches, and the model parameters are updated after processing each mini-batch. This approach provides a good balance between computational efficiency and stable convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Experimentation with Normalized Inputs\n",
    "- We compare model performance with normalized inputs versus non-normalized inputs. In our experiments, normalization improves convergence speed and overall accuracy, making it a critical step in the preprocessing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Evaluation and Results\n",
    "- The final model is evaluated on the test set, and metrics such as accuracy are computed to assess its performance.\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., modifying the number of layers, hidden units, learning rate) is possible and can lead to further improvements in model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project demonstrates the process of building and training a 2-layer neural network using PyTorch. The approach covers comprehensive data preprocessing, model construction, training with an adaptive optimizer, and evaluation on a realistic dataset. The implementation shows that careful preprocessing and hyperparameter selection are essential for achieving good performance on complex datasets.\n"

    "# Hyperparameter Selection and Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, several hyperparameters were chosen to optimize the performance of our 2-layer neural network on the Adult Income dataset. Below is a detailed explanation of the rationale behind each selected hyperparameter, as well as the choices regarding regularization and the optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hidden Layer Size (32 units)\n",
    "- **Selection:** A hidden layer size of 32 units was chosen.\n",
    "- **Rationale:**  \n",
    "  This modest size strikes a balance between model complexity and the risk of overfitting. A larger hidden layer might capture more complex patterns, but it could also lead to overfitting given the relatively simple structure of the network and the size of our dataset. Empirical testing indicated that 32 units were sufficient to learn useful representations without excessive computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Rate (0.001)\n",
    "- **Selection:** The learning rate was set to 0.001.\n",
    "- **Rationale:**  \n",
    "  The learning rate controls the step size at each iteration when updating model parameters. A learning rate that is too high may cause the training process to overshoot the minimum of the loss function, while one that is too low may slow convergence significantly. Based on common practice and initial experiments, 0.001 provided stable convergence with minimal oscillations in the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Size (64)\n",
    "- **Selection:** A mini-batch size of 64 was used.\n",
    "- **Rationale:**  \n",
    "  Mini-batch gradient descent offers a good compromise between the efficiency of processing multiple samples at once and the stability of the gradient estimates. A batch size of 64 is a common default that works well with many datasets and hardware setups, ensuring that model updates are frequent enough for smooth convergence while keeping computational demands manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of Epochs (100)\n",
    "- **Selection:** The model was trained for 100 epochs.\n",
    "- **Rationale:**  \n",
    "  Training for 100 epochs allowed sufficient iterations for the model to converge, as observed by the steady decrease in the loss value over time. While additional epochs might yield marginal improvements, the selected number of epochs provided a good balance between achieving a stable model and limiting the overall training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization Techniques Used:**  \n",
    "  No explicit regularization techniques (such as dropout or L2 regularization) were applied in this implementation.\n",
    "- **Rationale:**  \n",
    "  Given the relatively simple architecture of a 2-layer network and the quality of the preprocessed dataset, overfitting was not a major concern. The model was able to generalize well with the chosen hyperparameters. However, should signs of overfitting appear in further experiments, regularization techniques could be introduced to improve generalization further.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm Used:** Adam Optimizer\n",
    "- **Rationale:**  \n",
    "  The Adam optimizer was selected because it adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients. This leads to faster and more robust convergence compared to standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Adam’s adaptive nature makes it particularly well-suited for problems with sparse gradients or noisy data. The empirical results (final test set accuracy of 84.44%) confirmed that Adam was an effective choice for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Set Shape:** (21112, 96)\n",
    "- **Development Set Shape:** (4525, 96)\n",
    "- **Test Set Shape:** (4525, 96)\n",
    "- **Loss over Epochs:**  \n",
    "  The loss decreased steadily from the start to the end of the training (e.g., Epoch [10/100] Loss: 0.3060 to Epoch [100/100] Loss: 0.2734), indicating effective learning.\n",
    "- **Test Set Accuracy:** 84.44%\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the selected hyperparameters and the use of the Adam optimizer provided a good balance between model complexity, training efficiency, and generalization. The decision not to use additional regularization was based on the observation that the model did not exhibit significant overfitting. However, regularization techniques remain a viable option for future experiments if needed.\n"
